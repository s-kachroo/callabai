## Problem Statement

In today's dynamic work environment, remote/hybrid models, cross-functional collaborations, and globally dispersed teams have become prevalent. However, these shifts introduce challenges in fostering effective collaboration across diverse locations, time zones, and cultures.

Consequently, several issues arise:
- Lack of in-person interactions hinders building rapport, trust, and connection, while working from home may lead to distractions and reduced engagement from increased multitasking
- Divergent goals and priorities in cross-functional teams can cause conflicts and impede collaboration
- Cultural diversity in backgrounds, communication styles, and work norms can result in misunderstandings, disputes, and difficulties in establishing shared expectations and decision-making processes.

To address these challenges, we propose a solution that leverages voice data collected during meetings. Our solution provides comprehensive evaluations and insights into collaboration dynamics, participant engagement, and interpersonal interactions by incorporating AI-powered audio transcription and analysis. This approach enables organizations to identify areas for improvement, facilitate more effective communication, and foster a culture of collaboration across diverse teams.

We chose meetings as our data source because virtual meetings are becoming more common and possess the ability to integrate with AI. Additionally, online meetings make up a substantial and growing portion of employeesâ€™ medium of conversations and interactions, thus presenting a high potential for valuable insights and scalability.
